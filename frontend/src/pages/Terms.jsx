            FitFuel offers subscription-based meal plans that deliver meals on a recurring basis. By subscribing to our meal plans, you authorize us to charge your payment method on a recurring basis for the subscription fee plus any applicable taxes and delivery fees.

            Subscription charges are processed at the beginning of each subscription period (weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly, depending on your selection).

          <h3>3.2 Modification and Cancellation</h3>
          <p>
            You may modify or cancel your subscription at any time through your account dashboard. Changes must be made before the weekly cutoff time (Wednesday at 11:59 PM) to affect the following week's delivery. Cancellations made after the weekly cutoff time will take effect after the next scheduled delivery.
